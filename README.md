# ProductCatalog
ProductCatlog - Here we learn about the Model View ViewModel (MVVM) Design Pattern. We start by understanding how each component connects with themselves, then we implement an example project (Products API) using the MVVM pattern. We also learn how to bind our View with our ViewModel using the Closure(Data Binding) method.
